This is an unofficial mirror of [_xkcd_](https://xkcd.com/) and its related data by Randall Munroe.

_Warning: this comic occasionally contains strong language (which may be unsuitable for children), unusual humor (which may be unsuitable for adults), and advanced mathematics (which may be unsuitable for liberal-arts majors)._ – xkcd.com

The contents of this repository do not reflect the views of any repository contributors. Hopefully, that's enough to keep liberal arts majors from suing.
